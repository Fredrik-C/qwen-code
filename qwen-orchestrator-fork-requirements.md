### 5.2 Session Management Architecture

#### 5.2.1 Session Types and Lifecycle

**Session Types**:
- **Planning Session**: Contains requirements analysis, sequential thinking, and plan generation
- **Task Implementation Session**: Focused context for individual task implementation
- **Verification Session**: Objective assessment and completion checking
- **Interactive Session**: Current user conversation and command execution

**Session Lifecycle**:
1. **Creation**: Fresh session with specific type and purpose
2. **Execution**: Active AI interaction and state accumulation
3. **Persistence**: Save session state and context to storage
4. **Suspension**: Pause session while maintaining resumability
5. **Resumption**: Restore session context and continue interaction
6. **Completion**: Mark session as finished and archive

#### 5.2.2 Session Data Structure

```typescript
interface OrchestrationSession {
  id: string;
  type: 'planning' | 'task' | 'verification' | 'interactive';
  orchestrationId: string;
  taskId?: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  context: SessionContext;
  state: 'active' | 'completed' | 'suspended';
  metadata: SessionMetadata;
}

interface SessionContext {
  messages: Message[];
  artifacts: Artifact[];
  decisions: Decision[];
  currentFocus: string;
  sequentialThinking?: ThinkingSession;
}
```

#### 5.2.3 Context Loading Strategy

**Selective Context Loading**:
- Load only relevant context based on session type and purpose
- Use summaries and artifacts rather than full conversation history
- Maintain decision history for understanding rationale
- Preserve critical insights across session boundaries

**Context Types**:
- **Planning Context**: Requirements, constraints, architectural decisions
- **Task Context**: Task specification, acceptance criteria, related artifacts
- **Verification Context**: Completion criteria, test results, quality metrics
- **Cross-Session Context**: Shared artifacts, decisions, and progress state

### 5.3 State Management
- **Session Registry**: Track all sessions and their relationships
- **Persistent Storage**: File-based session storage in `.qwen/orchestration/sessions/`
- **State Synchronization**: Ensure consistency across session transitions
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Handle interrupted sessions and state corruption

### 5.4 Sequential Thinking Integration

#### 5.4.1 Mandatory Sequential Thinking for Planning

**Requirements**:
- `/plan` command must force usage of sequential thinking tool
- Planning sessions cannot proceed without structured reasoning
- Sequential thinking output becomes part of planning session context
- Thinking process is preserved for future reference and learning

**Implementation**:
- Detect when `/plan` command is invoked
- Automatically invoke sequential thinking tool before plan generation
- Structure thinking around requirements analysis, architecture decisions, task decomposition
- Save thinking session as part of planning session artifacts
- Use thinking output to inform plan generation and validation

#### 5.4.2 Optional Sequential Thinking for Other Commands

**Scenarios**:
- Complex task implementation that benefits from structured reasoning
- Verification sessions that need systematic assessment
- Problem-solving during task execution
- User-initiated thinking for complex decisions

**Implementation**:
- Provide `/think` command for manual sequential thinking invocation
- Integrate thinking results into current session context
- Allow thinking sessions to influence command execution
- Preserve thinking history across session resumptions

### 5.5 Integration Points
- **Command Router**: Extend existing session command system with session awareness
- **AI Interface**: Leverage existing AI interaction patterns with session context management
- **File System**: Use existing file operation utilities with session-scoped operations
- **Test Execution**: Integrate with existing process management and session state
- **Configuration**: Extend existing settings management for session and thinking preferences
- **Sequential Thinking Tool**: Mandatory integration for planning, optional for other workflows
